# String Operations Utility

This program performs various string operations based on user commands, including capitalization, reversal, length calculation, and palindrome checking.

- **String Capitalization**: Converts all characters to uppercase.
- **String Reversal**: Reverses the order of characters in the string.
- **Length Calculation**: Computes and displays the length of the string.
- **Palindrome Check**: Determines if the string reads the same forward and backward.
- **Interactive Command System**: Users enter a command (`cap`, `rev`, `len`, `pal`) followed by a sentence.
- **Exit Command**: Users can type `exit program` to terminate the program.

## Example Usage
```
Enter 'rev', 'cap', 'len', or 'pal' followed by a sentence (or 'exit program' to quit): cap hello world
Capitalized string: HELLO WORLD

Enter 'rev', 'cap', 'len', or 'pal' followed by a sentence (or 'exit program' to quit): len This is a test
Length of string: 14

Enter 'rev', 'cap', 'len', or 'pal' followed by a sentence (or 'exit program' to quit): pal racecar
The sentence is a palindrome.

Enter 'rev', 'cap', 'len', or 'pal' followed by a sentence (or 'exit program' to quit): exit program
Have a nice day!
