# String Operations Utility

This C project helps you manipulate strings with commands like capitalization, reversal, length calculation, and palindrome checking. The way it works is by taking user input, performing the selected operation, and displaying the result. You can enter commands like `cap`, which converts all letters to uppercase, `rev`, which reverses the order of characters in the string, `len`, which calculates how long the string is, or `pal`, which checks if you can read it the same way forwards and backwards (for example: racecar spelled backwards), followed by a sentence. If you're done, just type `exit program`. I created this to quickly handle common string operations without needing to rewrite them each time, and hope it can help you out as well.

## Example Output
```
Enter 'rev', 'cap', 'len', or 'pal' followed by a sentence (or 'exit program' to quit): cap hello world
Capitalized string: HELLO WORLD

Enter 'rev', 'cap', 'len', or 'pal' followed by a sentence (or 'exit program' to quit): len This is a test
Length of string: 14

Enter 'rev', 'cap', 'len', or 'pal' followed by a sentence (or 'exit program' to quit): pal racecar
The sentence is a palindrome.

Enter 'rev', 'cap', 'len', or 'pal' followed by a sentence (or 'exit program' to quit): exit program
Have a nice day!
